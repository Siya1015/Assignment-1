# Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

# Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

# Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

> Software engineering is a branch of the comnbination of both computer science and engineering that deals with designing, developing, testing and maintaining software applicatons.
Software enegineers can be regarded as architects and builders of softwares as they are required to design and create apps(computer games,operating systems) that run smoothly and 
ensure that there are no bugs in the apps.Software engineering is the backbone of digital innovation and plays a very important role in the technology industry. Software engineers
do not only design and develop software systems they ensure that the developed software sysyems are of high quality and are reliable.This appliction is very imporant where human life,
safety and financial transations are involved. Software engineering also plays a huge role in improving systems used in different organisations by improving efficency and productivity
by streamlining workflow, automating processes and reducing manual errors. This results in improved costomer satisfaction, increased competitiveness and cost friendly. last but not 
least, software engineers ensure that sensitive data is protected and they prevent cyber threaths.

#Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

> The first software engineering conference was held in Garmisch Germany in 1968. In the conferance it was argued that software development should be treated as a rigorous engineering
descipline and a need for  better software development methodologist toolsand technigues was highlighed. The term software engineering was inveted by Margaret Hamilton

> In the 1970s and 1980, Object-Oriented Programming(OOP) concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism and encapsulation were developed/introduced. The development of OOP led to an improvement
in software modularity, reusability and maintanability making it a fundamental paradigm in software engineering. Computer languages(C++, smalltalk and java popularized OPP etc) that even
today are still the cornerstone of software development were developed.

> In 2001, a manifesto called an Agile manifesto was created by a group of software developers which made a significant shift in the software development. The manifesto encouraged 
collaboration flexibility and rapid iteration which challenged the traditional waterfall approach.


# List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. 
> The phases of the Software Development Life Cycle(SDLC) are as follows:
  1. Planning phase:

# Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

# Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

# Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

# What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

# Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

# Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

# Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

# Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
